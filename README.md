# WhatsApp Web Bot (server)

> This project is for study and learning purposes and should not be used for commercial applications or that violate WhatsApp rules and guidelines.

This is the Back-end (server) of a robot for WhatsApp Web developed in **Python** that I started developing in late 2020 and that has a Front-end integrated in **Quasar Framework**.
This server uses **Firebase** as database.

Currently this project no longer works due to updates in the source code of WhatsApp Web.
